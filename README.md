# small_scale_ammonium_sulfate_precipatation_calculator - A  tool facilitating designing a pilot experiment to screen for protein precipitation conditions
 
For those not interested in the code behind this but just want to use the calculator, I'd suggest the web version of this tool [here](http://fomightez.pythonanywhere.com/ammonium_screen/).

The IPython notebook for this tool can be found [here](https://github.com/fomightez/small_scale_ammonium_sulfate_precipatation_calculator/blob/master/small_scale_ammonium_sulfate_precipitation_calc.ipynb) in this repo. In order to have a functional interactive version, you can click the `launch binder` button above. Alternatively, you can of course download it to work on your own computer set up for Jupyter notebooks or use it in the cloud on [Domino Data Lab](http://www.dominodatalab.com/), [Wakari.io](https://www.wakari.io/), or [SageMath Cloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com).

The screen this tool designs is based on Rebecca Oot's Small Scale Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation Screen. Rebbeca is a post-doc in Stephan Wilkens' laboratory, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, and she initially got the protocol for the screen from Erik Kish-Trier, a former graduate student in Stephan's lab.

It is intended to aid in choosing conditions for a larger scale precipitation step in a protein purification.  

Happy precipitating.
