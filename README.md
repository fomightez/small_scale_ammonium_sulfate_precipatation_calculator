# small_scale_ammonium_sulfate_precipatation_calculator - A  tool facilitating designing a pilot experiment to screen for protein precipitation conditions.
 
The IPython notebook for this can be found [here](https://github.com/fomightez/small_scale_ammonium_sulfate_precipatation_calculator/blob/master/small_scale_ammonium_sulfate_precipitation_calc.ipynb) in this repo. You'll need to download it and run it somewhere you have set to work with IPython or Jupyter Notebooks. (If you don't have your own computer set up for that, I'd suggest using Domino Data Labs, Wakari, or SageMath Cloud and working in the cloud.)

The screen this tool designs is based on Rebecca Oot's Small Scale Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation Screen. Rebbeca is a post-doc in Stephan Wilkens laboratory, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York.
It is intended to aid in choosing conditions for a larger scale precipitation step in a protein purification.  

Happy precipitating.
