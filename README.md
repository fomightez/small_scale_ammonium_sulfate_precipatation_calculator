# small_scale_ammonium_sulfate_precipatation_calculator - A  tool facilitating designing a pilot experiment to screen for protein precipitation conditions
 
For those not interested in the code behind this but just want to use the calculator, I'd suggest the web version of this tool [here](http://fomightez.pythonanywhere.com/ammonium_screen/).

The IPython notebook for this tool can be found [here](https://github.com/fomightez/small_scale_ammonium_sulfate_precipatation_calculator/blob/master/small_scale_ammonium_sulfate_precipitation_calc.ipynb) in this repo. In order to have the fully functional interactive version, you can click the `launch binder` button above or you'll need to download it and run it somewhere you have set to work with IPython or Jupyter Notebooks. (If you don't have your own computer set up for that, I'd suggest using [Domino Data Lab](http://www.dominodatalab.com/), [Wakari.io](https://www.wakari.io/), or [SageMath Cloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com) and working in the cloud.)

The screen this tool designs is based on Rebecca Oot's Small Scale Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation Screen. Rebbeca is a post-doc in Stephan Wilkens' laboratory, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, and she initially got the protocol for the screen from Erik Kish-Trier, a former graduate student in Stephan's lab.

It is intended to aid in choosing conditions for a larger scale precipitation step in a protein purification.  

Happy precipitating.
