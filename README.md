# small_scale_ammonium_sulfate_precipatation_calculator

The screen this tool designs is based on Rebecca Oot's Small Scale Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation Screen. Rebbeca is a post-doc in Stephan Wilkens laboratory, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York.
It is intended to aid in choosing conditions for a larger scale precipitation step in a protein purification.  
 
Happy precipitating.
